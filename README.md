## Description
This weeks challenge we were in charge of creating a weather application that gives you the weather for a current location as well as a five day forecast. We were unable to use latitude and longitude search queries as well as UV index queries because it was not available for free members. We ended up excluding UV index in the app and opting to use city search queries instead. This project has opened my eyes to the capabilities of server based APIs and I look forward to working with them some more.
